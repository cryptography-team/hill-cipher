# Hill Cipher Tool
You can use this tool to encrypt and decrypt information using matrices of any size up to 10x10. Larger matrices implies harder encryption but requires more time with this algorithm.

However, this is just an implementation of the algorithm since it was attacked because of the system linearity.
